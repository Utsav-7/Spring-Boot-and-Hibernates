# Development Process:
Step-1: Create a Java class and annotate as @Configuration (ex., SwimCoach) <br>
Step-2: Define @Bean method to configure the bean (ex., SportConfig) <br>
Step-3: Inject the bean into our controller <br>

- @Bean use case: Take existing third-party class and expose as a Spring bean
